        <p style="color: black">Today, Tigey was with the Coxes. Unfortunately, they had to depart in the middle of the day and went in different ways. Tigey was sad, but he lets nothing get in his way of being happy! He kept on cheering! He contemplated the universe and also ate a whole gallon of jelly beans (SWEET TOOTH ALERT). He's so funny. He cuddled with all of the other stuffed animals and basked in the sun, doing photosythesis (a process in which some organisms undergo to make energy for themselves using light energy, water, and carbon diozide) He looks like a tiger, but is actually a protist. A animal like plant-like protist to be exact. His full name is Tigey president Theodore Rossevelt Stuffed Animal Tiger Fish to-be-exact a hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Lin. Long name right? Hee Hee... Until next time! </p>

        <p>It's 6:55 AM right now. Early right? Well, Tigey is awake and active. Why? Because he's 
nocturnal! Meaning that he sleeps in the daytime and is active in the night! He has already eaten another gallon of jelly beans and also 5,000,000,000 bowls of mashed potatoes and spinach. Oh, did I not mention that his favorite food is mashed potatoes and spinach. And did you know he, even though he's almost as big as my torso, is a unicelluar organism! Unicelluar means the living thing(organism) only has one cell! A cell is defined as the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Basically the building block of all living things. In a more simple sense, if you are building a lego peice set, then the cell would be the plastic that makes the LEGOS. I'll see you soon! Byeeeee!</p>
