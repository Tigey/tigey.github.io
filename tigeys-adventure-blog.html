        <p style="color: black">Today, Tigey was with some friends, the Coxes. Unfortunately, they had to depart in the middle of the day and went in different ways. Tigey was sad, but he lets nothing get in his way of being happy! He kept on cheering! He contemplated the universe and also ate a whole gallon of jelly beans (SWEET TOOTH ALERT). He's so funny. He cuddled with all of the other stuffed animals and basked in the sun, doing photosythesis (a process in which some organisms undergo to make energy for themselves using light energy, water, and carbon dioxide) He looks like a tiger, but is actually a protist. A animal like plant-like protist to be exact. His full name is Tigey president Theodore Rossevelt Stuffed Animal Tiger Fish to-be-exact a hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Lin. Long name right? Hee Hee... Until next time! </p>

        <p>It's 6:55 AM right now. Early right? Well, Tigey is awake and active. Why? Because he's 
nocturnal! Meaning that he sleeps in the daytime and is active in the night! He has already eaten another gallon of jelly beans and also 5,000,000,000 bowls of mashed potatoes and spinach. Oh, did I not mention that his favorite food is mashed potatoes and spinach? And did you know he, even though he's almost as big as my torso, is a unicelluar organism! Unicelluar means the living thing(organism) only has one cell! A cell is defined as the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Basically the building block of all living things. I'll see you soon! Byeeeee!</p>

        <p>Tigey went to the Grand Canyon today! Above, you can see him in front of a view point. 
            We took many pictures of him. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm" target="_blank">The Grand Canyon</a> is home to elk, mule deer, rattlesnakes, and mountain lions. Do you know what Tigey would do if facing off with an apex predator ( a predator at the top of a food chain that is not preyed upon by any other animal)? He would try to make friends with the predator! Even in a dangerous situation, he loves to make friends and is very generous. </p>

        <p>Hi! Tigey's in Joshua Tree National Park! There are many desert plants covering the vast plain. Tigey went bouldering in the rocks... IN HIS SUPER JET... Hee hee. He doesn't get much excercise unfortunately. Tigey woke up in the rooftop tent and stared at the stars (Remember he's nocturnal?). He claims his freckles (He has 8 but thinks he has 7) is a constallation in the stars. But sometimes he's a little crazy. Anyway, we're in Joshua Tree National Park and hence the name, there are lots of Joshua trees. A whole forest of them! 
        They're so beautiful, and no camera can catch their unspoken beauty. They have a sense of nature, unsoiled by human hands. Anyway, I'll see you next time! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!</p>
